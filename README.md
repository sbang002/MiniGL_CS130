# MiniGL_CS130
This repository contains the work from UCR CS130 course MiniGL project.
This is an implementation of a simplified 3D rendering pipeline with flat shading.
This consist of several parts:
  1. Vertex and viewing transformations
  2. Rasterization
  3. Using a z-buffer for hiden surfaces
